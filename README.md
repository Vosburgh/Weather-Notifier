# Weather-Notifier
Simple weather notification application done through connecting to api's (Wunderground) and parsing information which is then sent to another api (Twilio) for a text notification.

Inspired from another similar project on github.

## Future plans: 
1. Create Java equivalent and make into android service.
2. Send notifications through multiple mediums (browser notif, facebook msg, email, etc.)
